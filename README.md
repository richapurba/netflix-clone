# netflix-clone

A personal project that has been made for fun. I still would like to improve this project, because if it's not really has netflix functionals, it's not a real netflix clone, isn't it?
Now, I'm trying to add some trailer function when you click a movie poster. Then I will add the firebase-stripe new extension into this project to receive the payment of subscription.
Next thing I'm trying to do is to make it responsive. I'm planning to use styled-components to add media queries and the basic style of a component in the same file.

You can preview the demo <a href="https://netflix-clone-peach.vercel.app/">here</a>.

If you want to run this project on your local machine simply clone this repo first by running this command on your terminal:

```git clone https://github.com/richapurba/netflix-clone```

Then please open the project in your favourite code editor (mine is VS Code) and do this following:

```cd netflix```
```yarn start```

Through these steps, the project will running successfully in your local server. Feel free to play with it.
Thank you.
